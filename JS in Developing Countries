Camilo Montoya

He is here legally in the US because of JS
Came from poor family in Columbia
Thankful for people like Kent C Dodds, Dan Abramov - they don't even know it

Poor people don't get chance to speak English in his country. So like him.
So now he is trying to transfer this knowledge to his people.

At first, it's frustrating, but then once you get it, it's wonderful.

Not everyone has opportunity/money to get to university to study

There are a lot of people with passion/dreams.
A lot of people don't speak english, so people are trying to teach in spanish (not a whole lot)

problems for people:
- not enough money for college
- no english
- high deseration rates at university
- education not oriented to problem solving
- not as much research as developed countries

PionerasDev, med.js, bogota.js, nodeco, MDE (reactjs) - JS communities for spanish (any for Thai???)
90% of people in these communities are poor

What are you giving to the world?
