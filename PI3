telebit.cloud - take a look - reverse VPN essentially
access devices - share your stuff - host website from an airplane or whereever (get out of localhost)
peer to peer apps
all under https:
Socks5 (lets you in, but nobody else)- could use to watch netflix videos from home computer while you're in europe
OpenVPN
SSH
DHT

Web Protocols are great
Check out Greenlock (nodejs - this guy made it)
tunnel everything over https (web, vpn, everything)

web is easy, tcp is not easy
Telebit - take a look!

Get PI3, run these commands:
telebit
telebit ssh auto (after install)
telebit http

need a relay to provide that https private peer to peer connection
